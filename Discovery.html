			<h2>Background Information</h2>
			<li> RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) can be thought of as a system that that sends out data when triggered through Radio Waves. ​</li>
            <li> Interrogator able to receive that info from RFID tags and read & store it. ​</li>
		</section>
        <section id="Objective">
			<h2>Objective</h2>
			<p>Because biometrics can be inferred from the reflections of RF energy, we can randomize the transmit power and tag ID to obfuscate those markers and to protect privacy.​</p>

            <p>Posted on April 18th, 2023</p>
            <ul>
				<li>Creation of the question and reading of literature to build up some common idea of what and how RFID works.  </li>
				<li>Creation of skeleton code that uses the interrogator library to conduct simple test on how RFID work, and how it can be modified and experimented on.​</li>
				<li>Developed prototypes with the experimental ideas of range, power of interrogator, and reassigning EPC codes on RFID tags. ​</li>
				<li>Determined that it was possible to change power levels of interrogator in a way that would allow it to be set to  any value while running a sleep cycle. Also, discovered that EPC codes are indeed viable option since reassigning does not interfere with power level sleep cycle. ​</li>
                <li>Implemented randomization function in code of power level and EPC code reassignment using a dictionary. Then implement formula to calibrate the received RSSI against it. ​</li>
                <li>Final test on code that makes sure randomize function works, and  optimization of runtime, and wrap up of website​</li>
